# Weekly Timesheet Approval, Week Closure & Hours Bank

## Done
- Schema: `pm_timesheet_weeks`, `pm_hours_bank_entries` (RLS, audit fields, lock trigger, one additional-hours row per week).
- Capacity resolver from existing HR contract fields (daily hours x days per week) — never hardcoded 40h.
- Week totals kept separate: project / internal / leave / working / accounted; only working hours compared to capacity.
- My Week card on `/projects/timesheet` with submit + confirmation; submitted/approved weeks lock editing.
- `/projects/weekly-approval`: week navigation, completion/approval/exception stats, filters, roster table,
  review panel with breakdown, explicit additional-hours acknowledgement (capped at calculated excess),
  approve / return / reopen with reconciliation of the ledger row.
- Hours bank panel: ledger with running balance, compensation into leave (creates a pending
  `autorizada_paga` request with provenance in the notes), paid compensation, manual adjustment with reason.
  Shown on the collaborator profile (manage) and on My sheet (read-only).
- Navigation entries under Projects and Time. EN + PT-PT translations. Typecheck + i18n parity pass.

## Open / needs live data
- Submit -> approve -> reopen -> re-approve was not exercised against production rows (would mutate real data);
  verify with a real week before wide rollout.
- Approve writes the week row and the ledger row as two calls; if a follow-up ever fails the week is closed
  without its ledger row. Candidate for a single database function later.

# Stage envelope & task allocations (Project Dashboard)

## Done
- `src/lib/projects/use-stage-envelope.ts`: derived stage envelope — capacity hours
  (baseline target hours, else sale value / avg sale rate), allocated hours, planned cost
  (per-resource effective cost rate), target planned cost from target margin
  (stage baseline -> project baseline -> 50%), projected margin, variance.
  `excludeAllocationId` so edits only move the delta. Nothing stored.
- `pm_tasks.notes` (nullable) — the only schema change.
- Task dialog does add + edit: parent stage context, live before/this task/after,
  capacity and margin warnings (non-blocking), notes.
- Double-click or kebab on a task row opens edit mode; delete already releases capacity
  because every rollup is derived.
- Stage rows show allocated/capacity hours + progress bar; planned cost vs target cost and
  projected margin only with `projects.financials`.
- Validated: acceptance maths (100h / 40h -> 80h -> delete -> 110h over) exact; preview
  renders chips and edit dialog with real data, no console errors.

## Open
- Gantt task bars still use the existing allocation popover editor rather than the new dialog.
- Planned vs Actual comparison view intentionally not built yet.
